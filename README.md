<h1>My Bank Application</h1>

I have created a bank application which is divided into 2 parts

I have created 2 portals for Admin and Customer

<h2>Functionality for admin:-</h2>
1. Register any customer with some validations<br>
2. View customer list with details<br>
3. Activate/ Deactivate customer

<h2>Functionality for customer:-</h2>
1. Send Money with Balance update<br>
2. view details of respective account<br>
