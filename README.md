My Bank Application

I have created a bank application which is divided into 2 parts 
1. Frontend(HTML Pages)- I have hosted my web pages on Tomcat server
2. Backend(API)- I have created my APIs in java language on Playframework 

Structure :-
I have created 2 portals for Admin and Customer

Functionality for admin:-
1. Register any customer with some validations
2. View customer list with details
3. Activate/ Deactivate customer

Functionality for customer:-
1. Send Money with Balance update
2. view details of respective account
3. view transaction history 

I have also created database in Mysql workbench 

Please configure the project accordingly.
This is a fun project. Always open to new ideas and changes
